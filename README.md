# Poker 
This is a web based Chinese poker game -- ShengJi(升级),  which I created during my spare time for my family to play :). 

# Install 
The server side is written by python using tornado. Therefore, you need to install [tornado] (http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/) package. 
The client side is written by javascript. The game should be working with web browser that supports web socket.

# Run 
To run the program, simply do:
    python cards.py 

The game should be accessible in localhost:8888. You can also configure it to run on public network.
